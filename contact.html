    		<p>- usually 3/4 cups on desk</p>

            <p>- shameless abuse of office supplies; informed my pilot pen
            yesterday that it would never amount to anything</p>

            <p>- have a wipeboard, use it for post-its</p>

            <p>Resposibilities include general complacency, coupled with some
            unpredictable intransigence. The latter I got, still working on the
            former. Also, I have an unrepentant current love of serifs.</p>

            <p>Here are some pictures of animals. Someday this will be some sort of
            magic working modul. Until then, let us content ourselves with fuzzy
            adorableness.</p><img src="img/babyturtle.jpg"> <img src=

            <p>- usually 5/6 cups on desk</p>

            <p>- shameless abuse of Adobe Creative Suite; beat the tar out of
            Photoshop when it wouldn't do what I wanted.</p>

            <p>- got a wipeboard, wrote some things on it, didn't do them.</p>

            <p>Resposibilities include attempting to rid the company of a heinous
            logo situation. Did not succeed. Unrepentant love of sans-serif.</p>

            <p>Here are some examples of work from that time. The work is meant to
            get progessivly worse the farther back in time you go.</p><img src=

            <p>- cup situation was simply out of control</p>

            <p>- shameless abuse of Printer; ran 150 lb cardstock on it cuz it
            needed to be taught a lesson about sassing me</p>

            <p>- had a lot less responsibility, didnt need to keep lists</p>

            <p>Resposibilities include doing whatever I was told, which has always
            been the one thing I am the worst at. Also, was literally the worst
            typographer.</p>

            <p>Here is my pile of terrible, uninformed + inexperienced design work.
            There are many like it, but this one is mine.</p><img src=

            <p>- client facing gig, so no cups allowed.</p>

            <p>Resposibilities included not telling people who called in a panic to
            shove off.</p>

            <p>I got this job cuz I needed a paycheck and a medical plan. Didnt
            intend on being part of the company. Had big theatre dreams, and then
            they sprouted little ennui buds which grew into full-on terror of dying
            in the street in a cardboard box; so I stayed. And made the most of it
            :).</p>

            <p>Here are pictures so you can properly visualize where I blossomed
            into career trajectory.</p><img src="img/babyturtle.jpg"> <img src=

            <p>PRODUCER THINGS OF NOTE- once sent a single pickup truck to get an
            entire stadiums' worth of projection equipment- waited with 200 pounds
            of used soil at 3 am for a pickup from an NYC community garden- called
            different unions in CA until one of them finally agreed to loan us
            thier giant rat balloon for a film shoot, provided we weren't filming
            anything 'sensitive, sexual or political'- the amount of lying a human
            does when in charge of massive creative projects is terrifying</p>

            <p>GENERAL MANAGER THINGS OF NOTE- this one time, a Technical Director
            I hired, fought for and vouched for went off his meds and threw my
            staff out of his shop, stranding 4 people and 1 minor with no
            transportation in suburban New Jersey- had an actor who refused to
            abide by the sex choreography done in rehearsal, and the ensuing phone
            call was possibly the wierdest and most awful conversation I've ever
            had with another human- pulled multiple shards of glass out of an
            actors foot while simultaneously running fight call and show setup,
            then washed my hands and went to open house and take tickets; this was
            all while the Village Voice was onsite for a documentary piece on the
            NYC Fringe. I am in the Village Voice as 'Emergency Surgery was
            performed'- there is no such thing as too much paperwork or
            communication. Be annoying. Write multiple emails. Make a scene. Do not
            let anyone get away with ignoring you.</p>

            <p>PRODUCTION MANAGER THINGS OF NOTE- screwed 65 light bulbs into a
            chandalier while waiting for theatre doors to open at 6:45 am- have
            made/recieved more phone calls past 1 am than phone sex operators- you
            never really know what trust is until you leave your build in the hands
            of volunteers; people have enormous capacity to execute and surprise. I
            learned that doing this job.</p>

            <p>STAGE MANAGER THINGS OF NOTE- threw my first diva fit over coffee,
            it was supposed to be iced, they brought me hot. AND they forgot the
            straw. it still makes me mad- had an invisible battle of wills with
            Tovah Feldshuh over a light cue, she wanted to hold the beat longer,
            and I moved the light when I was told. I could feel her willing me to
            change the light back. I did not. Me: 1, Tovah Feldshuh: 0.- leadership
            means opening the doors and turning out the lights; you are the first
            one in and the last one out. - if you don't know, know that you will
            soon.</p>

            <p>ASSISTANT STAGE MANAGER THINGS OF NOTE- tried to break up a
            fistfight in the dressing room, and accidentally got punched in the
            face. There's no quicker way to end a fistfight- there's nothing quite
            like doing a quickchange with stage blood- do not play practical jokes
            on the wrong actors- when you get a compliment, never say 'thank you',
            always say 'I know'</p>

            <p>PROPS MASTER THINGS OF NOTE- drank a full bottle of wine and then
            went to work, ended up shirtless and covered in dye; still don't know
            what exactly happened- do not make props that actors have to use out of
            paper towel inner tubes and dixie styrofoam bowls- do take gigs that
            are completely over your head and out of your skill set</p>

            <p>COSTUME DESIGN THINGS OF NOTE- I know I did this for a while, but I
            can't remember any of the shows- always keep careful record of
            everything you do, because later, when you go to make a resume or
            portfolio, and you have these big gaping places lost in a haze of
            overwork and alcohol, you will regret it</p>

            <p>WARDROBE THINGS OF NOTE- worked out of my boss's tiny Harlem apt,
            she and her husband were hoarders, so I would have to clear a space
            every day to make a table to lay out patterns- did hella emergency
            sewing on the subway; i could whipstitch on the train the same way most
            women put on makeup. Like a boss.- got kneed in the head during a
            quickchange, didn't realize the extent of my injury until I wondered
            who spilled stage blood all over the prop table.- never sleep with
            anyone whose pants you get paid to take off.</p>

            <p>ELLIS ISLAND THINGS OF NOTE- 'I'm on the island for the rest of the
            day' is the best excuse in the world- when people with strong religious
            convictions go to see a show with kissing in it, and then stop the
            actors mid pucker to tell them not to kiss, that's not really a
            situation you can prepare for. I shrugged at them from the booth, they
            settled for holding hands- British people are the most polite tourists
            in the world</p>

            <p>GRAPHIC DESIGN THINGS OF NOTE- i did a lot of show branding and
            theatre design as supplementary income over the years, and there is
            nothing so untrue as a theatre client saying 'we just need a logo
            design'. THIS IS FALSE. DO NOT BELIEVE THEM.</p>

            <p>THEATRE CRITIC THINGS OF NOTE- reviewed theatre for a while as part
            of theasy.com- once got into a huge internet fight with the playwright
            whose show I panned. He said I was a lazy, indulgent fool who wouldn't
            know good theatre if it ran over me. I said he was a self-important,
            over-written douchebucket. I'd lay money down that I'm still right.</p>

            <p>ASSISTANT DIRECTOR THINGS OF NOTE- got drunk for the first time
            while AD-ing Virginia Woolf in college. It was a bottle of Korbel
            brandy in the theatre's basement- loved the directing, hated the
            assisting</p>

            <p>DIRECTOR THINGS OF NOTE- when I direct, I have no conciousness of
            time passing. Which is the strangest and most beautiful of things to
            not be conscious of.</p>

            </nav>

            <p>This was a year long directing internship at Portland Stage Company
            in Maine (picture of the house from deck because google images). We
            worked deck, we crewed, we did design, we assistant directed and
            directed, we did laundry and got drunk, we fought, hated, and sexed
            each other. Every day was a literal Greek Tragedy And I Wouln't Trade
            It For Anything. There's a lot of my love sunk into this place.</p>

            <p>I was a directing intern at the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey
            (picture of theatre because google images). This meant I assisted the
            directors of the tour group in addition to working on my own directing.
            I was way in over my head and made all the mistakes and it was awesome;
            there was no fear of failure. Working actively to get that fearlessness
            back.</p>

            <p>Art School (picture of school, deal with it). This is where I
            learned that I would never, ever be a painter. For my thesis, I built a
            whorehouse in the gallery and performed as a madam during the gallery
            opening. Which, in retrospect, is really obnoxious. Sorry, everyone I
            graduated with. I was too impressed with my own presumed cleverness to
            think about how you might feel about my 'we are all whores' statement.
            Whoops.</p>

            <p>Worked box office here for 3 years, and there was a director who got
            so angry he threw a chair. It has since and will always be my life goal
            to be powerful enough to throw a chair and get away with it.More
            importantly, I got to meet Chita Rivera when she was doing a show there
            and all I could manage to one of my showbiz idols was 'I like your
            sparkly eyeshadow'.</p>

            <p>Picture of the building so you can properly visualize my eprsonal
            version of hell. Despite its inherent awful, it is where I learned the
            thing I use every day: Maimonedes said that you can't find the middle
            until you've been to both ends. In my experience, he is %100
            correct.</p>

            <p>I'm going to open with 'He's a tramp' from Lady and the Tramp, and
            all my band will be boys wearing boxers + suspenders and hats, and they
            will be the dog chorus, howling in the background while I sing in a
            sparkly red number with killer heels, way too much eye makeup and a
            drink. IT'S HAPPENING, YOU GUYS. STAY TUNED.</p>
